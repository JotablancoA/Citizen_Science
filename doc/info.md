### About the project:
The use of camera traps to study wildlife has increased exponentially in recent years due to their ease of use and relatively low cost. However, experiences that combine this technique with citizen science to improve knowledge about wildlife distribution are very scarce. This study presents the results of an educational experience in different schools in the province of Córdoba, Spain, where camera trapping and citizen science were implemented to analyze the abundance and diversity of wild mammals in the surroundings of educational centers. The data obtained by camera traps in 11 UTM grids of 10x10 km were compared with observations available between 2008 and 2023 in GBIF and with unvalidated observations on citizen science platforms. In total, the camera traps generated 1,605 sequence records, resulting in 589 daily records of 15 wild mammal species concentrated in a four-month sampling period. This volume of data is comparable to that shared in GBIF in those areas over the last 15 years. Additionally, species whose presence had not been detected or confirmed at the 10x10 km UTM grid level were documented, as well as species with a reduced number of records. Geographic factors and sampling effort associated with species richness were also identified. These results suggest that the use of camera trapping in combination with citizen science in educational centers can generate a significant volume of verifiable and reliable data, thus contributing to improving knowledge about the distribution of wild mammal species.

### The main objective was:
 to assess that school participation can generate a significant volume of reliable data on the distribution of wild mammals, comparable to the historical records available on platforms such as GBIF. The results showed that, over a four-month period, camera trapping produced a large number of records, documenting previously unconfirmed species and suggesting that this approach is a viable strategy for updating distribution atlases and promoting scientific literacy in education.

### Project Design and Geographical Context
The study was conceived as an educational and citizen science experience carried out between January and April 2024 in the province of Córdoba, Spain.
• Participants and Scope: A total of 11 educational centres and 800 schoolchildren aged between four and twelve participated in the IncluScience-Me and ConCiencia-2 projects. The aim was to promote scientific, participatory and social dimensions, stimulating interest in science and conservation.
• Role of Students: Students were encouraged to actively participate in the design of hypotheses, observation, collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of data. An essential activity was the placement of camera traps.
• Study area: Sampling covered 11 UTM grids of 10x10 km near educational centres in Córdoba, covering various habitats such as agricultural areas (olive groves), pastures and dense scrubland.

### About methodology:
A crucial part of the methodology was to compare the data generated by the school project with historical data.
• Data Sources Compared: The 4 months of camera trap records (2024) were compared with: GBIF (2008–2023) and unvalidated records from Observation, iNaturalist, and iMammalia (up to 2023).
• Comparison Standard: The data were projected onto 10x10 km UTM grids to align with species distribution atlases in Spain.
