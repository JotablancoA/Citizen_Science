About the project:
The use of camera traps to study wildlife has increased exponentially in recent years due to their ease of use and relatively low cost. However, experiences that combine this technique with citizen science to improve knowledge about wildlife distribution are very scarce. This study presents the results of an educational experience in different schools in the province of Córdoba, Spain, where camera trapping and citizen science were implemented to analyze the abundance and diversity of wild mammals in the surroundings of educational centers. The data obtained by camera traps in 11 UTM grids of 10x10 km were compared with observations available between 2008 and 2023 in GBIF and with unvalidated observations on citizen science platforms. In total, the camera traps generated 1,605 sequence records, resulting in 589 daily records of 15 wild mammal species concentrated in a four-month sampling period. This volume of data is comparable to that shared in GBIF in those areas over the last 15 years. Additionally, species whose presence had not been detected or confirmed at the 10x10 km UTM grid level were documented, as well as species with a reduced number of records. Geographic factors and sampling effort associated with species richness were also identified. These results suggest that the use of camera trapping in combination with citizen science in educational centers can generate a significant volume of verifiable and reliable data, thus contributing to improving knowledge about the distribution of wild mammal species.
